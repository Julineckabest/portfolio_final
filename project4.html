            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                In an age of digital connection, we paradoxically feel more isolated. This installation emerged from research into how people perceive and value their social networks. Through interviews with 30 participants, I discovered a common thread: people struggled to visualize the true depth and breadth of their relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                The installation invites visitors to physically map their social network by placing objects in space. As they build their network, the system responds with light patterns, spatial audio, and subtle environmental changes — creating a living representation of human connection.

            <h2>Development Journey</h2>
            
            <div class="narrative-section">
                <h3>Phase 1: Research & Concept (Weeks 1-3)</h3>
                <p>
                    Began with ethnographic research: conducted semi-structured interviews, observed how people discuss their relationships, and analyzed social network visualizations from academia and art. Discovered that existing visualizations felt clinical and disconnected from emotional reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developed three concept directions: (1) abstract data sculpture, (2) collaborative drawing space, (3) tangible network builder. User feedback overwhelmingly favored the tangible approach — people wanted to "feel" their networks through physical placement.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="full-width-image" style="margin:60px 0;">

            </div>

            <div class="narrative-section">
                <h3>Phase 2: Technical Prototyping (Weeks 4-8)</h3>
                <p>
                    Built proof-of-concept using Arduino and Processing to validate tracking approach. Tested various object types: RFID tags (too limiting), IR markers (unreliable), and finally settled on color-coded physical tokens tracked via overhead camera.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Migrated to Unity for production system, implementing custom computer vision pipeline. Developed calibration tool allowing installation in spaces with different dimensions and ambient lighting conditions. Achieved 98% tracking accuracy with sub-100ms latency.

                <h3>Phase 3: Visual & Audio Design (Weeks 9-12)</h3>
                <p>
                    Designed lighting behaviors based on network properties: connection density affected brightness, relationship strength controlled color temperature, and network centrality determined pulse frequency. Created 12 distinct light patterns corresponding to different social structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Composed generative soundscape using granular synthesis. As users add connections, harmonic layers emerge; removing connections creates dissonance. The sonic environment reflects the health and complexity of the represented network.

                <h3>Phase 4: Installation & Exhibition (Weeks 13-14)</h3>
                <p>
                    Exhibited at university's Media Arts Festival for two weeks. Over 200 visitors interacted with the installation, spending an average of 8 minutes each — significantly longer than typical interactive art engagement times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Observed fascinating behaviors: couples built networks together and compared patterns, individuals experimented with different network configurations, and groups returned multiple days to refine their maps. The installation became a conversation starter about digital-age relationships.

            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                This project taught me that the most compelling interactive experiences emerge from genuine human questions, not technical capabilities. The technology served the concept, not the reverse.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I were to revisit the project, I'd explore machine learning for pattern recognition, enabling the system to identify and name different network types ("close-knit cluster," "hub-and-spoke," etc.). I'd also investigate persistent storage, allowing visitors to save and revisit their networks over time.
