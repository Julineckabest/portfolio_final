                    <h2>Experience Overview</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of the digital environment/game is to show the player what a section of the Craiglockhart campus (Dottyville) was like when it was used as a war hospital during WW1. It is an educational experience that allows the player to view first-hand the history of the building. The experience could be played using desktops or can be filmed as a walkthrough for the Craiglockhart War Poets exhibition. The War Poets exhibition's success shows there will be interest in the environment and will be a valuable visual asset to support the collection. The target audience for the project are people interested in WW1 history, poetry, and the evolution of the building itself. This is due to Craiglockhart having such a rich history, with influence on modern perception of war, from the war poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. In addition, the unique history of the building itself, from a convent to a hydropathic hotel and then temporary war hospital. This project is intended for users with a basic understanding of online games and require no previous knowledge on unity or the history of the building. The experience fits into the entertainment and educational genre.</p>

                    <p>I was responsible for the 3D environment design and implementation in Unity. This included creating multiple assets in Blender, searching suitable textures and third-party assets, and integrating all elements into the Unity project. I also developed MENU system on the beginning (start game) and middle (pause menu + resume game) of the experience and.</p>

                    <p>Started with competitive analysis of 8 health apps, followed by user interviews and contextual inquiry sessions. Created affinity diagrams to synthesize findings and identify common patterns across user behaviors.</p>
                    <p>Developed three primary personas: The Casual Tracker, The Data Enthusiast, and The Recovery-Focused Athlete. Each persona had distinct needs and interaction patterns that informed design decisions.</p>

                    <h3>02 — Story & Narrative</h3>
                    <p>The simple story of the game/3D environment is you work at the hospital and you're going around collecting writings from the patients for the hydra magazine, the magazine that the patients of the hospital write for as one of the Doctors in the hospital suggested that writing would help their conditions. Apart from the premise there isn’t much story as it is mainly about viewing the environment.</p>
                    <p>In terms of narrative, the experience is designed to be exploratory and non-linear. The player can choose which areas of the hospital to explore and in what order. The narrative is conveyed through environmental storytelling, with visual cues and interactive elements that reveal the history and atmosphere of the hospital.</p>

                    <h3>03 — UI </h3>
                    <p>The user interface of the game/3D environment has been created to be as accessible for all audiences by making the design simple and non intrusive. There is limited heads-up display (HUD) which allows the player to see more of the environment.</p>
                    <p>Key tasks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a crosshair that changes to red when it hovers over objects that the player can inspect and rotate to get a better view of it.</li>
                        <li>When the player looks at a writing it glows yellow/green and then after left clicking the user can read the writing, the player can right click to get rid of it.</li>
                        <li>To access the menu during the gameplay the player only needs to press the escape key which will pause the gameplay and display the menu which gives the options resume, options, and main menu. In options the player can adjust the volume settings</li>
                        <li>When interacting with any of the “collectable” interactions, a popup will appear indicating the collection name and progress.</li>
                        <li>There are also audio cues that are activated during the player’s exploration to aid immersion and helps to make the experience more engaging.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Built a high-fidelity interactive prototype with 42 screens and comprehensive component library. All components were designed with accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA) in mind.</p>

                    <p>The development of the Dottyville environment was carried out using (Unity verison - 2023.2.20f1), with the goal of creating a historically grounded environment with meaningful interaction.</p>
                    <p>Key development tasks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Built in Unity using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP)</li>
                        <li>Primary language: C#</li>
                        <li>Core tools: Unity’s Rigidbody physics, TextmeshPro, and standard UI components</li>
                        <li>No third-party packages or asset store plugins were used.</li>
                        <li>Compatible with Windows operating systems; deployed as a standalone .exe & Video</li>
                        <li>Sound was custom-mixed while using Unity’s built in sound features</li>
