                    I was always the creative one. Drawing, sewing, getting lost in art 
                    galleries, sketching ideas on my tablet.
                    I started my journey after completing my qualifications in Economics and Transportation in 2019. 
                    I quickly began working in Telecommunications as an Administration Specialist in a small family business in Prague. I loved the variety of my work, working with clients and solving problems, and cooperating with marketing teams. 
                    After a few years, I decided to move abroad to improve my English and gain new experiences. I moved to the Netherlands and started work as an au pair and later on as a machine operator.

                My goal was to improve my communication skills, and I decided to 
                move to an English-speaking country—the United Kingdom. First, I 
                moved to London, where I stayed for one year, and later moved to 
                Edinburgh.
                <p>
                    I started learning by stepping out of my comfort zone and working 
                    in customer-facing roles—from hospitality to call centres. I learned 
                    how to work under pressure, communicate with a variety of customers, 
                    and understand different cultures.                </p>

        <h2 class="about-duo-heading">Curiosity is my superpower</h2>
        <p>
            When I felt confident enough with my language skills, I signed up 
            for college and decided to follow my long-time dream: entering the 
            creative industry.

            I did exceptionally well during my first year of NC (Software 
            Development and Digital Design), so I decided to continue my studies 
            while working on projects at night after work. I was recommended to 
            a Scottish charity, FastForward, for a paid project as a web game 
            developer, using my coding/JavaScript skills and graphic design.

            I also started volunteering for two programs—Edinburgh Libraries and 
            ICE IT Edinburgh—tutoring elderly people and job seekers on digital 
            devices, the internet, and tools like Microsoft Suite and social media.        </p>
        <p>
                Afterwards, I went to Napier University to study Digital Media and 
                Interaction Design, where I focused on UX and interaction design, 
                as well as visual communication and storytelling. I discovered my 
                passion for games, Virtual and Mixed Reality, and 3D modelling, and 
                took part in development projects in those fields.

                My course was wonderfully multidisciplinary, and I had the opportunity 
                to improve my skills in graphic design and video development, and to 
                work on team projects across a range of roles.        </p>
